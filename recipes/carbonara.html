    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Carbonara has been the subject of some severe bastardization here in the
      states, where we regularly eschew Italian tradition in favor of garlic,
      bacon, and green peas for some reason. Today we're doing both the
      old-school and illegitimate versions of the hotly-contested dish, both of
      which deserve their place in your grandmother's handwritten recipe cards.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound guanciale (can substitute with pancetta)</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>4 ounces of cheese (Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano)</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>16 oz spaghetti noodles</li>
      <li>1/4 cup starchy pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by dicing ½ pound guanciale or pancetta. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl or measuring cup, combine 3 large eggs and 1 egg yolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate and measure out 4 ounces of cheese - I recommend Pecorino Romano
        or Parmigiano-Reggiano or a blend of the two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine grated cheese and eggs and beat together with a fork until
        homogenous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the egg and cheese mixture with fresh black pepper. Do not add
        salt yet, because the guanciale brings a lot of salt to the dish. Beat
        until well incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced guanciale to a cold pan and then turn the heat to medium.
        This will allow the fat to render out slowly. Once it is fully cooked
        but not too crispy, turn off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your noodles to a large pot of heavily salted water. Cook until they
        are to your desired texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the guanciale. Toss to coat the
        noodles in the guanciale fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Work quickly to add the egg and cheese mixture to the pan and mix
        rigorously. This will help to emulsify the sauce and make it creamy. If
        it’s as smooth as you’d like, you can add a little bit of pasta water
        (about ¼ cup). Season with salt if it needs it.
      </li>
      <li>Plate up and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
